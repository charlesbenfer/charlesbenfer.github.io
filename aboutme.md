My name is Charles Benfer, and I have a strong background in mathematics, specifically data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics. Several project I have completed include (in reverse chronological order):

- Using predictive modeling to influence transfer portal acquisitions in Division 1 SEC Baseball
- Using predictive modeling to improve pitcher performance in Division 1 SEC Baseball
- Predicting phenotypic properties of Zea mays (field corn) using genetic and environmental predictors
- Predicting bacterial resistence levels in Chickens
- Which is more important: Pitching or Hitting? Using regression to understand what make a winning baseball team.

Many of these data sets are proprietary, but some repos can be found on my GitHub page for these analyses.

### My story

Began my mathematics careers as an educator, graduating in 2021 from Mount Saint Mary College with a BA in Mathematics and a MS Ed in Adolescent Mathematics Education and Special Education. After teaching middle school for one year, I moved to Auburn, Alabama to pursue a PhD in mathematics, specializing in Graph Theory. In my first year, I found a love for data analysis, specifically its applications in the sports world.
