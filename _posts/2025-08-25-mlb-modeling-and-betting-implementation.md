# From Features to Profits: Building a Production MLB Betting System

Building sophisticated features is only half the equation in sports betting analytics. The real challenge lies in transforming those features into reliable models that can consistently identify profitable opportunities in live markets. After developing a comprehensive 255+ feature engineering pipeline ([detailed here](https://charlesbenfer.github.io/2025-08-21-mlb_feature_engineering_report/)), I faced the critical task of building production-ready models and implementing a complete betting system capable of real-time decision making.

This writeup chronicles the journey from engineered features to a functioning betting system—covering the modeling approaches, comparative analysis framework, comprehensive testing methodology, and ultimately the production betting implementation that generates actionable recommendations with Kelly criterion-based position sizing.

## The Modeling Challenge: Beyond Standard Approaches

The transition from features to predictions required solving several interconnected challenges that standard machine learning workflows don't typically address:

1. **Temporal integrity**: Preventing data leakage in time-series sports data
2. **Model selection**: Identifying the optimal algorithm for this specific prediction problem
3. **Performance optimization**: Achieving sub-millisecond inference for live betting
4. **Calibration**: Ensuring predicted probabilities accurately reflect true likelihood
5. **Production deployment**: Building systems robust enough for financial applications

The stakes were higher than typical ML projects—inaccurate predictions don't just hurt model metrics, they lose money.

## Dual Model Architecture: Balancing Accuracy and Speed

### Core Design Philosophy
Rather than relying on a single modeling approach, I implemented a dual-model system designed to balance different performance criteria:

- **Enhanced Model**: Maximum accuracy using all 255+ engineered features
- **Core Model**: Streamlined version using only the most predictive features for ultra-fast inference

This architecture allows the system to provide detailed analysis when time permits while maintaining the ability to make rapid decisions during live betting scenarios.

### Model Implementation Details

The system leverages two complementary algorithms:

**XGBoost Implementation**:
- Gradient boosting for non-linear feature interactions
- Custom hyperparameter optimization focused on sports betting metrics
- Built-in handling of missing values and categorical features
- Feature importance analysis for model interpretability

**LightGBM Alternative**:
- Faster training and inference for live applications
- Memory-efficient architecture for large datasets
- Advanced categorical feature handling
- Parallel processing capabilities for batch predictions

Both models implement identical preprocessing pipelines, ensuring consistency between training and inference phases.

### Time-Aware Data Splitting

Sports betting models face a unique challenge: they must predict future events using only historical data available at prediction time. This required implementing sophisticated temporal splitting logic:

```python
class DataSplitter:
    @staticmethod
    def time_based_split(df, date_column='date', 
                        train_ratio=0.7, val_ratio=0.15, gap_days=0):
        """
        Chronological splitting to prevent data leakage.
        Includes optional gaps between train/val/test to simulate
        real-world prediction scenarios.
        """
```

Key innovations in the splitting approach:
- **Chronological ordering**: All training data precedes validation data, which precedes test data
- **Gap implementation**: Optional buffer days between splits to prevent leakage from overlapping games
- **Proportional sizing**: Maintains consistent class distributions across splits while respecting temporal boundaries

## Comparative Analysis Framework: Systematic Feature Engineering ROI

### The 8-Step Experimental Design

To quantify the impact of each feature engineering step, I developed a comprehensive comparative analysis framework that evaluates model performance across progressive feature additions:

| Step | Category | Features Added | Description |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Baseline** | Core Statistics | 58 | Traditional batting statistics |
| **Step 1** | Matchup History | +17 | Batter vs pitcher historical performance |
| **Step 2** | Situational Context | +33 | Game state, inning, pressure situations |
| **Step 3** | Weather Impact | +20 | Temperature, wind, atmospheric conditions |
| **Step 4** | Recent Form | +24 | Time-decay weighted performance metrics |
| **Step 5** | Streak/Momentum | +29 | Hot/cold streaks and momentum indicators |
| **Step 6** | Ballpark Factors | +35 | Park-specific adjustments and dimensions |
| **Step 7** | Temporal/Fatigue | +41 | Time-of-day, circadian, and fatigue modeling |
| **Step 8** | Interactions | +35+ | Feature combinations and composite indices |

### Performance Results: Quantifying Feature Engineering Impact

The systematic approach revealed dramatic improvements in model performance:

**Best Model Performance (Step 8 - Interactions)**:
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.9098 (91% accuracy in ranking home run probability)
- **Precision**: 0.360 (36% of predicted home runs actually occur)
- **Recall**: 0.764 (capture 76% of actual home runs)
- **Feature Count**: 203 optimized features
- **Feature Engineering ROI**: +105% improvement over baseline

**Most Impactful Feature Category**:
The situational context features (Step 2) provided the largest single improvement, boosting ROC-AUC by +17.9%. This highlights the critical importance of game state awareness in baseball prediction—the same batter performs dramatically differently in high-leverage situations versus routine at-bats.

### Training and Test Periods

The analysis used a rigorous temporal validation approach:
- **Training Period**: 2024-04-01 to 2024-08-31 (5 months of comprehensive data)
- **Test Period**: 2024-09-01 to 2024-10-31 (2 months of completely unseen data)

This approach ensures that all model evaluation metrics represent genuine out-of-sample performance, providing realistic expectations for live betting applications.

## Comprehensive Testing Methodology: Production Readiness Validation

### Multi-Layer Testing Architecture

Building a system reliable enough for financial applications required extensive testing across multiple dimensions:

**1. Feature Engineering Validation**
- Individual feature calculation accuracy
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Data quality and missing value handling
- Feature interaction validation

**2. Model Performance Testing**
- Cross-validation with time series constraints
- Robustness testing with edge cases
- Calibration analysis for probability accuracy
- Feature importance stability analysis

**3. Production Inference Testing**

### Key Testing Innovations

**Production Inference System**:
The most critical innovation was the development of a production-ready inference system that pre-computes and caches historical matchup data in an optimized SQLite database:

```python
class InferenceFeatureCalculator:
    """
    Production-optimized feature calculation system.
    Achieves sub-millisecond lookups through pre-computed matchup database.
    """
```

**Performance Achievement**: Reduced feature calculation time from 400+ milliseconds to under 3 milliseconds—a 147,169x speed improvement that makes real-time betting applications feasible.

**Temporal Integrity Validation**:
Every feature calculation includes built-in temporal safeguards to prevent data leakage:
- All rolling statistics properly lagged with `.shift(1)`
- TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation for temporal data
- Systematic checks for look-ahead bias

## Betting Implementation: From Predictions to Profits

### Expected Value Framework

The betting system implements a sophisticated expected value calculation that goes beyond simple probability comparisons:

**Core EV Formula**:
```
EV = (Model_Probability × Payout) - (1 - Model_Probability) × Stake
```

**Advanced Considerations**:
- **Vig removal**: Adjusting for bookmaker overround in two-way markets
- **Market efficiency**: Identifying lines that differ significantly from fair odds
- **Confidence weighting**: Higher confidence in model predictions for certain scenarios

### Kelly Criterion Implementation

Position sizing follows the Kelly criterion for optimal bankroll growth:

```python
def calculate_kelly_fraction(true_probability: float, american_odds: float) -> float:
    """
    Kelly formula: f = (bp - q) / b
    where p = probability of win, q = probability of loss, b = payout multiplier
    """
```

**Safety Modifications**:
- **Quarter Kelly**: Using 25% of calculated Kelly fraction for risk management
- **Maximum position**: Capping bets at 2-5% of bankroll regardless of Kelly calculation
- **Minimum edge requirements**: Only betting opportunities with EV > 3-5%

### Real-Time Betting System Architecture

**Daily Workflow**:
1. **Morning Data Update** (`fetch_recent_data.py`): Pull fresh MLB data with complete feature engineering
2. **Multiple Daily Predictions** (`live_prediction_system.py`): Generate predictions throughout the day with configurable thresholds

**Command Line Interface**:
```bash
# Conservative opportunities (higher confidence threshold)
python live_prediction_system.py --min-ev 0.05 --min-confidence 0.70

# More aggressive opportunities (lower thresholds)
python live_prediction_system.py --min-ev 0.02 --min-confidence 0.60
```

### Risk Management Implementation

**Portfolio-Level Risk Controls**:
- **Maximum daily exposure**: Limiting total daily betting amount
- **Diversification requirements**: Avoiding concentration in single games or players
- **Drawdown limits**: Automatic position reduction after losing streaks
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time tracking of actual vs predicted results

## Personal Reflections and Lessons Learned

### The Complexity of Production Systems

Building a betting system taught me that the technical challenges extend far beyond modeling accuracy. The most sophisticated model is worthless if it can't generate predictions fast enough for live betting, or if the risk management system fails during a losing streak.

The most valuable lesson was understanding the difference between research-quality code and production-ready systems. Every component needed to handle edge cases, gracefully degrade when external services failed, and maintain consistent performance under varying loads.

### The Psychology of Systematic Betting

Implementing automated betting decisions revealed the psychological challenges of systematic approaches. The temptation to override the system during losing streaks, or to increase position sizes during winning streaks, required building explicit controls and decision frameworks.

The Kelly criterion, while mathematically optimal, needed practical modifications to account for psychological factors and implementation realities. Quarter-Kelly sizing emerged as the optimal balance between growth and sustainability.

### The Iterative Nature of Production Development

Perhaps the most important insight was that production systems are never "finished." The baseball betting market constantly evolves, requiring ongoing system improvements, feature updates, and risk management refinements.

The modular architecture proved essential for maintaining and improving the system. Each component—feature engineering, modeling, betting analysis, risk management—could be updated independently without disrupting the entire pipeline.

## Future Development and Extensions

### Broader Applications

**Multi-Sport Extension**:
The systematic approach to feature engineering and betting analysis could extend to other sports with rich statistical data—basketball, football, hockey, and tennis all offer similar opportunities for sophisticated modeling.

**Market Making Applications**:
The accurate probability estimation capabilities could support market-making activities, providing fair odds for peer-to-peer betting platforms or informing bookmaker pricing models.

## Conclusion

Transforming sophisticated feature engineering into a profitable betting system required solving challenges that extended far beyond traditional machine learning workflows. The integration of temporal data handling, production-optimized inference, comprehensive risk management, and real-time decision making created a system capable of identifying and capitalizing on market inefficiencies.

The 91% ROC-AUC performance achieved through systematic feature engineering provided the foundation, but the real value emerged from building production systems capable of translating predictions into profitable actions. The Kelly criterion-based position sizing, comprehensive risk management, and real-time processing capabilities transformed accurate predictions into a complete betting platform.

Perhaps most importantly, this project demonstrated that successful sports betting systems require equal attention to statistical modeling, software engineering, and risk management. The most accurate model is worthless without reliable production infrastructure, and the most sophisticated system fails without proper risk controls.

The systematic approach to feature engineering evaluation, production optimization, and betting implementation provides a replicable framework for sports analytics applications. While this implementation focused on MLB home run prediction, the methodologies extend to any domain where sophisticated feature engineering can provide predictive advantages.

For practitioners working on similar systems, the key insight is that production readiness must be considered from the beginning. Building systems that work reliably under real-world conditions—with missing data, API failures, and time pressure—requires different engineering approaches than research prototypes.

The complete system continues to operate daily, generating predictions and identifying betting opportunities. Most importantly, it provides a foundation for ongoing research into market efficiency, optimal betting strategies, and the practical application of machine learning to financial markets.

The journey from features to profits revealed that success in sports betting analytics requires mastering not just statistical modeling, but systems engineering, risk management, and the psychology of systematic decision making. The technical challenges were significant, but the insights gained extend far beyond sports betting to any application where machine learning meets real-world financial decisions.
