# Project Description

## Collaboration Details
In the Fall 2024 semester, I completed my master's capstone project for the withthe Bayer Corporation (specifically Dr. Katiana Kontolati and Dr. Fabiana Freitas Moreira). The my partner in the project was Yasin Fatemi, Ph.D. student in the Auburn Engineering Department, and our faculty mentors were Dr. Roberto Molinari and Dr. Nedret Billor.

## Project Motivation
As indicated by the title of the project, the overall goals involved influencing the breeding practices for corn plants. When corn plants, or pretty much any plant or animal, is created from two distinct parent lines, it tends tends to display favorable charactaristics: this is the concept of "heterosis", and is the basic motivation behind most breeding practices. The main project that is being explored at the Bayer corporation is called "hybrid mining", which is the practice of modeling the phenotypic qualities of the corn plants based on their genetic charactaristics, and motivating breeding practices based on those qualities. For our capstone project, the goal was to incorporate the environmental characteristics in which the corn was grown, along with the genetic characteristics, and see if this would result in better model performance than either set of predictors by themselves.
